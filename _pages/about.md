Hi! I'm Yingzi Gao (高英梓), an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University.

I obtained my Ph.D. from the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), where I focused on the security of distributed systems. 

My research interests include:
- Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols
- Distributed key generation and reconfiguration
- Threshold cryptography
- Blockchain systems security
